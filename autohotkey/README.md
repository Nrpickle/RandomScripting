This file contains my documentation for my autohotkey scripts that I've developed over time. They're mostly productivity-based, but some are more random than that.

## Omnipresent 

This script is always running on machines that I control. It contains multiple personalizations.

### Windows

## Caps Lock

I rebound the traditional "Caps-Lock" functionality to "Shift-Caps", while turning Caps Lock into another Control Key.

### Altium Designer Shortcuts
Altium really lends itself to automation, there are tons of shortcuts that are available to the user. This document will describe some of them that are made easier through this script.

#### Suppler Search
To access Supplier Search while in Altium, simply press F1.
